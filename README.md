👋 Hi, I'm @josemagnodev!

👀 I'm passionate about Backend development using PHP and Java, and I'm equally enthusiastic about crafting Frontend solutions with React.

🌱 Currently, I'm dedicated to my studies in Information Systems at Universidade Federal do Ceará, where I'm honing my skills and expanding my knowledge in the realm of software development.

💞️ I'm eager to collaborate on GitHub and share my knowledge with the community. Whether it's contributing to open-source projects, sharing insights, or collaborating on exciting software endeavors, I'm always up for the challenge.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me via email at josemagno.dev@gmail.com. I'm looking forward to connecting with fellow developers and exploring new opportunities in the world of technology.
